# Dota_Net v.1.0   (MatLab version) 

No one likes to play dota and in the middle of the match drop the internet and / or has delay actions. Worse of scenario is go to low. Because of this I created a script that makes a diagnosis of the internet and says if it is safe for you to play or not.

## How to execute

> Execute: ping_database.m

Wait for the time you want. When more is better. The script Creates a database of net stability.

> Execute: dota_net.m

Say if you can play or not and other important statistical stuffs.
