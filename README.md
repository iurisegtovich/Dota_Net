# Dota_Net v.0.0001   (MatLab version) 

Nobody likes to play dota and in the middle of the match drop the internet and / or has delay actions. Worst case scenario is go to low. Because of this I created dota net to make a diagnosis of the internet and says if it is safe for you to play or not.

## How to execute

Download all the scripts.

> Execute: ping_database.m

Wait for the time you want. How much more is better. The script creates a database of net stability.

To follow next steps:

> Cancel: ping_database.m

In case you don't know how to cancel: 'ctrl + C'

> Execute: dota_net.m

Say if you can play or not and other important statisticals stuffs.

## tips

Leave running _ping_database.m_ for as long as the computer is connected unused.
